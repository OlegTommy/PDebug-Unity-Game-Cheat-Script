# PDebug Unity Game Cheat/"Hack" Script
PDebug is a script for Unity (written in C#) that allows users to use "cheat" functions.

## Ingame Console
Of course there is also an ingame console where the user can see all logs/warnings/erros!

## Edit an GameObject ingame
In the Objects tab you can use the mouse and the "i" key to select a GameObject (The mouse position is called up by the target camera, which can also be changed!) As soon as you have selected a GameObject, you can deactivate/activate it, destroy it , the position, rotation & scale display and change, deactivate/activate individual components

## Ingame Time Controll
In the "Time" tab you can display the deltaTime and timeScale, and you can also change the timeScale as you like to speed up or slow down the game.

## Easy to implement
The script was only written with GUI, which means that it does not need any external variables that have to be specified in the editor, it simply has to be added to an object!

With the program dnSpy (https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) you can add the script to a compiled Unity game, but you have to add the script somewhere, which should be easy!

## Is3D Boolean
Don't forget to set the is3D bool correctly in the script!
